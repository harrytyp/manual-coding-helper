Coding Helper for the manual classification of text in Excel or CSV files.

I was frustrated while manually creating training data for machine learning, that you can choose to either
- use overengeneered software like doccero which brings in a lot of complexity
- or stare at your excel sheet all day long

So my goal was to create a simple and efficient python GUI to help me with my annotations.
